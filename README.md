# StingRay
A raytracing engine based on Peter Shirley's book: Ray Tracing in One Weekend. 

## Building
The first stage of building is to run CMake in the root directory of the project:
`CMake .`

This will generate the Makefile as well as the bin, and lib folders. 

The main and test executables are then built my running the Makefile generated by CMake. In the root directory run:
`make`

## Running
The main renderer binary is built into the bin folder of the project. The renderer outputs raw image data in ppm format, and therefore to save the file you need to pipe the program into a new ppm file. For example from the root directory of the project:
`./bin/stingRay > ~/Desktop/demo.ppm`

The test binary is also generated into the bin folder. The tests are simply run by executing the generated binary:
`./bin/tests_run`
